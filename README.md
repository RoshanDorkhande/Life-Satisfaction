# Life-Satisfaction

This is a Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Model 

I've taken the GDP of the countries as the Independant variable and life satisfaction as the dependant variable

The predictions of this model are not perfect because GDP is not the only factor that affects the Life Satisfaction of people.
